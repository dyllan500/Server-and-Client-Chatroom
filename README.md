# Server-and-Client-Chatroom
Made these python scripts while learning how to do python network
All you need to chage the ip in client to the ip address of the server
Make sure the ports match each other
Then start the Server first
Then start the Clients

For use over lan use the servers lan ip for the client
Match sure if you can the port the server and client ports match

For use over wan use the server internet ip given from your isp for the client
Make sure you create port forward for the port the server is going to use if neccasary
You can search Google on how to do that

What I would like to add to the code is encrytped connnection and a gui
